# CepheusEngine_TravellerRPG_Map_Generator
Generates a dataframe of planets and systems according to the cepheus engine rules.

To use this file first launch an instance of Secteur_VPublic.ipynb
It will ask how many systems grids of 20x20 (a big Traveller RPG sector) you want.
Then it will ask for the name of the region where these sectors are.
Finally it asks for the path you want the region to be written. Write down the absolute path with '\' at the end.
Check the directory

Then launch the Planete_VPublic.ipynb
It will ask the name of the directory where you created the region then it will ask the name of the region.
You'll have 2 sets of files describing the stars characteristics and the main planet characteristics.
It should be lightweight enough for everyone's PC, except if you decided to generate two galaxies worth of maps.

Cepheus engine uses Open Content sources thus GURPS Traveller and Mongoose wouldn't shut this repository like they did for many.
-Hopefully
Enjoy,
